Allegro 5.0 bindings for Chicken.

== Disclaimer

Due to personal time constraints I have not fully tested these bindings, yet. If you discover any bugs, or even if you believe that some bindings could have a better implementation then please contact me with details.

And yes, the Egg does take a bloody long time to compile.

== Help!

I have limited time these days. If you could undertake any of the following it would be greatly appreciated:

1. Submit issues you discover to the GitHub issue tracker
2. Submit feature requests to the GitHub issue tracker
3. Correct any errors you discover in this documentation page
4. Add documentation where it is lacking
5. Send me an email if you find this egg useful!

== Supported Versions

Allegro versions 5.0.x up to 5.0.6 are supported. All 5.0.x versions should work, but features added post-5.0.6 will not be available.

Future version support will likely be added in the future. Patches are welcome!

== Naming Key

In general, the naming is fairly indicative of the function's behaviour.

The gist is something like this:

; make-type : Constructs a type (Not always available)
; make-type* : Constructs a type, returning a value which must be manually destructed
; free-type! : Manually destructs a type (Not available for internally managed types)
; type-noun : Accessor for value "noun" on a specific type
; type-noun-set! : Mutator for value "noun" on a specific type
; type-verb : Method which requires a specific type to operate
; type-verb! : Method which modifies an object of a specific type
; verbage : Function which operates on the global state
; verbage* : Function which operates on the global state, but also returns a value which must be manually destructed

If a function begins with a type name then you can be assured that the first parameter will be an object of that specific type.

== Naming Key

In general, the naming is fairly indicative of the function's behaviour.

The gist is something like this:

; make-type : Constructs a type (Not always available)
; free-type : Destructs a type (Not available for internally managed types)
; type-noun : Accessor for value "noun" on a specific type
; type-noun-set! : Mutator for value "noun" on a specific type
; type-verb : Method which requires a specific type to operate
; type-verb! : Method which modifies an object of a specific type
; verbage : Function which operates on the global state
; verbage* : Function which operates on the global state, but also returns a value which must be manually destructed

If a function begins with a type name then you can be assured that the first parameter will be an object of that specific type.
